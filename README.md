ADBC is an interactive web application used to learn database design concepts and SQL. ADBC was originally developed by Dr. Meg C. Murray, Professor of Information Systems at Kennesaw State University and was funded by NSF Grant #0717707.

This project ports ADBC from it's original Java/Flash implementation to a HTML5/PHP implementation using the [Yii Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/).

The goals of this project are as follows:

* Reduce application footprint in terms of memory both volatile and persistent
* Make the source code more understandable and maintainable
* Use MVC to remodel the application
* Record meticulous documentation such that future students may continue work

See the [wiki](https://github.com/zyrolasting/adbc-yii/wiki/) for more information.
